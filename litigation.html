      <h1>Strategic Litigation as a Tool for Legal Implementation</h1>

      <p>The law's regenerative aims are realized when principles are applied and clarified through use, especially in courtrooms. Strategic climate litigation is a practical mechanism to test and develop key concepts—duty of care, proportional responsibility, adequate causation, and environmental protection—so that they guide real decisions and behavior. By bringing targeted cases, litigants ensure that these principles are interpreted by judges and anchored in facts, rather than remaining aspirational.</p>

      <p>In Switzerland and across Europe, litigation supports the enforcement of constitutional rights and evolving duties related to climate and ecological harm. Courts are increasingly willing to recognize cumulative and probabilistic causation where robust scientific attribution is presented. Methods such as TCRE-based emissions quantification provide a reliable basis for causal arguments and proportionate liability. In this way, litigation not only resolves individual disputes but actively shapes legal norms to address systemic risks, ensuring the law keeps pace with scientific understanding and fulfills its regenerative function.</p>
