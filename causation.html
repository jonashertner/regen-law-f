      <h1>Evolving Legal Causation in a Complex, Interdependent World</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Causation in Complex Systems</h2>
        <p>As a general legal principle, causation should reflect the reality that many harms in complex systems arise from interdependent actions rather than a single source. The law must ensure that responsibility is not avoided merely because a contribution is one among many. When collective activities degrade planetary systems, each contribution should be recognized as part of the causal chain of harm.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Climate Change and Cumulative Harm</h2>
        <p>Greenhouse gas emissions from individuals, corporations, and states accumulate in the atmosphere and collectively warm the planet. No single emission causes climate change alone, yet each emission is a real part of the overall harm. Legal causation should therefore be understood as cumulative and proportional: each emitter bears responsibility in proportion to their contribution. This recognizes scientific reality and fairness—avoiding a loophole where diffuse harms escape accountability.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Attribution Using TCRE</h2>
        <p>Modern climate science allows quantitative attribution. The Transient Climate Response to Cumulative Emissions (TCRE) shows a near-linear relationship between total carbon dioxide emitted and global warming. In practice, this enables calculation of how much warming (and associated damages) a given quantity of emissions will produce. Project-level emissions can thus be linked to concrete outcomes—such as additional heat exposure, mortality, or ecosystem loss—providing a clear evidentiary basis for causation.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Tort Law: Proportional Liability and Foreseeability</h2>
        <p>To address planetary-scale harms, tort doctrines can adopt proportional liability where each contributor is responsible for its share of the damage. Foreseeability is met: the harmful consequences of sustained greenhouse gas emissions have been known for decades. This supports finding that contributions are sufficiently connected to the harm to satisfy legal requirements, even when multiple actors are involved.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Reframing causation to reflect dynamic interdependence enables courts and policymakers to assign responsibility proportionate to contribution. With robust scientific methods such as TCRE-based attribution, climate harm can be established to the degree required by law, closing the gap between complex reality and enforceable accountability.</p>
